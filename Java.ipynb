Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary Python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.

If the main method won’t be static, JVM would not be able to call it because there is no object of the class is present.\n",

This has been done to keep things simple because once the main method is finished executing, java program terminates. So there is no point in returning anything, there is nothing that can be done for the returned object by JVM. If we try to return something from the main method, it will give compilation error as an unexpected return value. For example, if we have the main method like below.\n",

These models are trained on vast amounts of data to discern language patterns and to furnish contextually appropriate answers.\n",
